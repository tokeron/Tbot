# Tbot_2021
This project is a telegram bot that built to help students at the Technion.
This project was initially developed by Michael Toker.

Today we are a team of 9 students, from universities all around Israel. 
Our goal is to learn from each other, to work in a team,
and to develop new features together in order to make a bot that will be useful.

The bot is writen in JavaScript. 
we use google script in order to host the code, and we use telegram API for the front end.
