# Tbot
This project is a telegram bot that built to help students at the Technion.
This project was initially developed by Michael Toker.

Today we are a team of 9 students, from universities all around Israel. 
Our goal is to learn from each other, to work in a team,
and to develop new features together in order to make a bot that will be useful.

The bot is written in JavaScript. 
we use google script in order to host the code, and we use telegram API for the front end.

If you want to join our team I highly recommend reading the following [repo](https://github.com/tokeron/telegram_bot_101).
You are more than welcome to clone the code and add features.
You are also welcome to connect me in any issue by email: dontokeron@gmail.com
