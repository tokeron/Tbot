# Tbot_2021
This project is a telegram bot that built to help students at the Technion.
This project was initially developed my Michael Toker.
Today we work in a team of 12 students, from universities all around Israel. 
Our goal is to learn from each other, to work in a team,
and to develop new features together in order to make a bot that will be more useful.

The bot is writen in JavaScript. 
we use google script in order to host the code, and we use telegram API for the front end.
